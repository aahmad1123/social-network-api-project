# social-network-api-project
build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list using  Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. 

First I created the schemas in the models folder according to the rubric README. Then I created the user controllers and user routes at the same time to be able to test them immediately rather than work on all controllers or all routes at the same time. Then I worked on the thought controllers and routes.
