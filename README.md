# social-network-api-project
build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list using  Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. 

First I created the schemas in the models folder according to the rubric README. Then I created the user controllers and user routes at the same time to be able to test them immediately rather than work on all controllers or all routes at the same time. Then I worked on the thought controllers and routes. Finally I worked on the friends routes. I had trouble getting the thoughts and friends to push to their associated arrays at first because I was hard assigning Ids that only allowed for single instances of thoughts or friends to be added to any given user. Unfortunately I was not able to figure out how to successfully add reactions to thoughts.
